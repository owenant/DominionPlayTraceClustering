The notebook in this repository is used to analyse and cluster Dominion playtraces generated using code in owenant/DominionPlayerLogs repo or using the TableTop Games Framework fork, owenant/TabletopGames_ForDominionPlayTraces.
The code clusters playtraces using K-Means, K-Medoids, DBSCAN and Spectral Clustering in order to identify different player strategies.
